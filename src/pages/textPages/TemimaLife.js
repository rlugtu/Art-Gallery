          Temima Gezari came to the United States as a nine month old baby. She
          was born Fruma Nimtzowitz on December 21, 1905 in Pinsk, Russia. She
          grew up in Brownsville, Brooklyn with her parents, sister Etta and
          brother Ruby. The family lived in the back room of her father’s
          hardware store on Pitkin Avenue. When things got better they moved to
          an apartment above the store, which was heated by a coal stove in the
          kitchen.

          Her mother Bella (Nee Cohen) was a gentle, traditional and observant
          woman who loved things of beauty. She appreciated Temima’s art but
          gave the practical problems of life higher priority, and never
          understood the importance of it until she saw Temima’s synagogue mural
          in 1935.

          Her father Yisroel was a serious and philosophical man who became
          progressively more disillusioned over the condition of the world. He
          worked hard, and often found comfort with his friends at the Labor
          Lyceum. He was not a religious man, yet he placed great importance on
          culture and tradition.

          Her father recognized her artistic talent as a very young child and
          actively encouraged it. At the age of seven he took her into Manhattan
          to the Education Alliance with the hope of enrolling her in art
          classes. He told her he would take her to school every day from
          Brooklyn by train, a personal gesture which had a powerful effect on
          little Temima, her first realization that her art was being taken
          seriously. As it turned out there were no art classes for children, so
          her father invested in the art supplies and piano lessons for her
          instead.

          Temima graduated from Brooklyn Girls High School in 1921 and the
          Teacher’s Institute of the Jewish Theological Seminary of America in
          1925. Her ﬁrst art teacher was Bulah Stevenson, an inspiring woman who
          had a great inﬂuence on Temima’s early development as an artist. She
          went on to study art at the Parsons New York School of Fine and
          Applied Arts with Emil Bisttram and Howard Giles (1923-1927), the
          Educational Alliance in New York with Raphael Soyer (1926), and the
          Art Students League in New York. She painted with Diego Rivera on his
          murals at Rockefeller Center (1933). She also studied at Columbia
          University, the New School for Social Research, and Hunter College.

          Professor Mordecai Kaplan was person who had a great inﬂuence on her
          professional life. In 1935, as Dean of the Teachers Institute of the
          Jewish Theological Seminary, he appointed her to the faculty, where
          she taught art education and art history for forty-two years.

          In 1940, Dr. Alexander Dushkin, director of the newly formed Jewish
          Education Committee (now the Board of Jewish Education og Greater New
          York) asked Temima to be the Director of the Department of Art
          Education. She worked there for 65 years, retiring at age 95. She
          taught art history and art education at Columbia University and at the
          Jewish Theological Seminary of New York, and received an honorary
          Doctor of Letters degree from the Jewish Theological Seminary at the
          age of 85 for her lifetime work in art education.

          Temima’s book, Footprints and New Worlds (1957), in its fourth
          edition, deals with her philosophy of education and child development
          through her experiences in art with children and adults.

          Temima Gezari was an uncompromising humanist and staunch advocate for
          human creativity. She discovered, and actively promoted, a new
          approach to the development of children’s full human potential—to
          recognize their great innate creativity and encourage them to express
          and develop it through their original art. She has dedicated her life
          to helping others ﬁnd this creative self, while exploring the
          dimensions of her own spirit. Temima worked actively for 95 years as
          artist and professional educator with skill and energy. She brought an
          opportunity to recognize in her art, and in ourselves, the creative
          capacity of the human being.

          Temima met Zyi on the Kibbutz Mishmar Haemek transport bus when she
          arrived in Haifa, Palestine to paint as artist-in-residence in 1936.
          The bus was full, so the driver invited her to sit on a gas can next
          to him. She thought this would be great fun, to be able to talk to the
          driver and see the sights. Just as she sat down, a very handsome young
          man called from the back to offer her his seat. She declined, but he
          persisted. Zyi rode on the gas can, chatting with the driver, while
          Temima simmered with anger in his seat. She swore she would never have
          anything to do with that fresh guy again. They were married in Tel
          Aviv in 1938 and moved back to New York, where their sons Daniel and
          Walter were born in 1942 and 1944.

          Zyi was born in Poland in 1910 and went to Palestine in 1928 where he
          worked building new kibbutzim and studied. In 1958 he arrived in New
          York speaking only a few words of English. On his first day in New
          York he registered for engineering courses at Columbia University. By
          1940 he spoke standard American English without any trace of an
          accent. He became an industrial engineer, and went on to develop and
          manage a large steel fabrication factory. Zyi is a very progressive
          man, deeply interested in history and science. In 1954 he built a
          telescope for Albert Einstein.

          In the Spring of 1947, Temima and Zyi took the boys for a ride on Long
          Island, to the beach town of Rocky Point. With the last ten dollars in
          his pocket, Zyi gave a deposit to a farmer for a piece of apple
          orchard on a hill overlooking the sound. The house, studio and
          observatory he designed and built there, have been the creative and
          idealistic focal point of the family and local community ever since.

          She tells of an experience at about that time which was later to play
          an important part in shaping her approach towards people, education
          and art. “The day that my third-grade teacher in public school came
          into the room with an open book in her hand, went to the blackboard
          and copied from it the picture of a bird, was a very crucial day in my
          life. The bird was sitting on the branch of a tree. It was lamely
          drawn, a bad copy from the sample in the book. The teacher handed out
          sheets of drawing paper and crayons and told us to draw the bird. “The
          one who does it best,” she said, “will get a gold star. We all went to
          work. I looked at the bird on the blackboard. It seemed to me so
          clumsy, so lacking in grace, it could never spread its wings and fly.
          I was a very young child, but I knew that the strange creature on the
          blackboard was not right, and my instinct refused to make me a partner
          in that miserable process. So, I did not copy the bird on the
          blackboard, but drew my own. Needless to say, I did not get the gold
          star... but my bird was flying!”
