          “I have taught many university courses over the years. The first day
          of class I tell the students that they have all passed the course.
          There are no examinations at the end of the semester. I am not
          interested in what dates or names they remember.”

          “I never teach with a textbook. I tell my students I will give them a
          list of books to read in their old age, when they are too old to get
          around to museums and galleries. I want them to have a wonderful
          experience. Now, while you are young and strong, go out and look and
          experience. Be humble. Don’t say “you call that art?” Come back again
          and again. Soon there will be communication, because you have reached
          out for understanding.”

          “I have my students work with art materials in all my courses because
          I believe, as Rousseau said, “A child may forget what he sees, and
          sooner still what is said to him, but he will never forget what he has
          made.”

          “I am an artist and an art educator. I love both careers. I don’t
          believe you are really an artist unless you have a concept to share.
          On the other hand, you are not a good art educator unless you are a
          functioning artist and have the challenges of the artist before you.
          An art educator, with skills and capabilities to give the world, is
          twice blessed.”

          ART AND CHILD DEVELOPMENT

          “Children instinctively have the knowledge of our world. It amazes me,
          what a child can do with one stroke. The art medium provides children
          with a universal language, through which they can express ideas and
          feelings that they may find difficult to convey in words. Through
          manipulation of basic materials, children develop confidence, courage,
          and creative spirit. People, especially parents, must be brought to
          the realization that art should become part of everyone’s experience
          to develop their greatest capability. A child’s creativity and
          perception of the world must be encouraged. An adult may look at a
          child’s painting and say, ‘I never saw a purple cow.’ When the child
          proudly holds it up. Of course, the child hasn’t either, but was
          looking with imagination. An understanding parent or teacher will tell
          the child, ‘that’s the most beautiful cow I’ve ever seen!’ ”

          “My philosophy of art is that the fundamental principles of art can be
          found in the artwork of a two-year-old, work which the child does
          instinctively.”

          Temima Gezari organized international exhibits of children’s art
          annually from 1943 to 2004. “First, the children learn that their work
          is accepted. We respect and appreciate their effort. With this
          acceptance they can go on to the exhibition and is proud to see their
          creation displayed. They look at other children’s work and learn that
          there are many ways of expressing the same subject. They learn to
          appreciate the efforts of htheir peers. Teachers see how other
          teachers have utilized the art medium to motivate their students. This
          expands children’s knowledge, and they go on to the next step in their
          development. Have you ever seen the absorbed concentration in
          children’s faces when they are permitted to do the creative work they
          love? There is intensity and involvement, no bribe is necessary.”

          “Prizes in art are basically destructive and self-defeating. The
          winner’s gratification is gained at the price of the rejection of
          those who failed. To rule that their best isn’t good enough is to
          inflict needless damage on their self-esteem. I reject the argument
          that contests provide incentive for productivity.”

          “No coloring books!! The young children who learn to please their
          elders by staying inside the lines of coloring book drawings, grow up
          to be a followers, not leaders. This is the beginning of conformity.
          The seeds of a mentality that accepts without questioning.”
