            been held annually since 1943 at such museums as the American Museum
            of Natural History, the Museum of the City of New York, the Brooklyn
            Museum, the Jewish Museum and the Riverside Museum in New York and
            at the Board of Jewish Education in New York. These exhibitions have
            been arranged for the purpose of giving children an opportunity to
            show the art that they have been doing throughout the year on a
            purely educational and aesthetic level. It is felt that every child
            should be given an opportunity to use the art media for the sake of
            their individual growth and happiness. For this reason, any element
            which may make for competition has been intentionally omitted
