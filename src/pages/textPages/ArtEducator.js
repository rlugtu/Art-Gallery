          “I am an artist and an art educator. I love both careers. I don’t
          believe you are really an artist unless you have a concept to share.
          On the other hand, you are not a good art educator unless you are a
          functioning artist and have the challenges of the artist before you.
          An art educator, with skills and capabilities to give the world, is
          twice blessed.”

          “The creative process gives meaning to life. When we finally learn
          that we are creative, we have an altogether different feeling about
          ourselves. When we feel good about ourselves, we feel good about our
          neighbors. This can lead to a peaceful world, where artist can create
          for the aesthetic pleasure of all people.”

          “I never teach with a textbook. I tell my students I will give them a
          list of books to read in their old age, when they are too old to get
          around to museums and galleries. I want them to have a wonderful
          experience. Now, while you are young and strong, go out and look and
          experience. Be humble. Don’t say “you call that art?” Come back again
          and again. Soon there will be communication, because you have reached
          out for understanding. I have my students work with art materials in
          all my courses because I believe, as Rousseau said, “Children may
          forget what they see, and sooner still what is said to them, but he
          they never forget what they have made.”

          “What I have done is to demonstrate my philosophy of art, that the
          fundamental principles of art can be found in the world of a
          two-year-old… work which the child does instinctively.”

          “The art medium provides children with a universal language, through
          which they can express ideas and feelings that they may find difficult
          to convey in words. Through manipulation of basic materials, children
          develop confidence, courage, and creative spirit. People, especially
          parents, must be brought to the realization that art should become
          part of everyone’s experience to develop their greatest capability.”

          “A child’s creativity and perception of the world must be encouraged.
          An adult may look at a child’s painting and say,” I never saw a purple
          cow.” When the child proudly holds it up. Of course, the child hasn’t
          either, but was looking with imagination. An understanding parent or
          teacher will tell the child, “that’s the most beautiful cow I’ve ever
          seen!”

          Temima Gezari has organized international exhibits of children’s art
          annually since 1943. “First, the child learns that his work is
          accepted. We respect and appreciate his effort. With this acceptance
          he can go on to the exhibition and is proud to see his creation
          displayed. He looks at other children’s work and learns that there are
          many ways of expressing the same subject. He learns to appreciate the
          efforts of his peers. Teachers see how other teachers have utilized
          the art medium to motivate their students. This expands their
          knowledge, and they go on to the next step in their development.

          “The young child who learns to please his elders by staying inside the
          lines of coloring book drawings, grows up to be a follower, not a
          leader. This is the beginning of conformity. The seeds of a mentality
          that accepts without questioning.”
